"""
Google Places API (New) wrapper for SmartLeadGen.

Why Places API instead of scraping Google Maps directly:
  - Google's Maps *website* is a JS-heavy, bot-defended surface that was
    never meant to be scraped. Selectors change, headless browsers get
    silently served empty/blocked pages, and it's against Google's ToS.
  - The Places API is Google's own official, structured, documented way
    to get exactly this data (name, address, phone, website, rating).
    No browser needed at all, which also means no Chromium binary to
    fight with on free-tier hosting.

Cost control: Places API (New) bills by the *highest-tier* field in your
field mask. We deliberately request only what SmartLeadGen actually uses.
Phone/website/rating fall in the "Enterprise" tier — see README for
current pricing notes and how to set a quota cap so you can never be
billed past what you expect.
